Here is a link to my project that I'm most proud of.

It's a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project I completed as part of my Machine Learning and AI bootcamp at UT-Austin.

In this project, I took a dataset of Twitter reviews, and performed Sentiment Analysis to determine the positivity or negativity of tweets.

Tools I used in this project:
- Pandas
- NLTK
- Spacy
- Sci-kit Learn (Random Forest and Randomized Search statistical analysis)
